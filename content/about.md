KORITEK (KOminote RIral TEKnology) is a non-profit organization whose primary mission is to build different pathways for the technology wise illiterate students in the rural area;”Haiti”.  Our main aim is to equip their schools with the tools that are really required for a better education to overcome the technology gaps in Rural Area. We provide special trainings to the respected teachers so that they may able to educate the children of Haiti in a well manner. Unfortunately, there is no electricity and technology oriented devices such as computers or tablets in any of their school’s classrooms.

We found enthusiasm for teaching and learning in the people of Haiti and that is why we have been taken the broad step to equip their schools with some source of electricity and some latest technology. We are trying to enable those areas as technology giants. We need a big hand from your business to support us in our light spreading program.
