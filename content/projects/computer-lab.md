This Project will benefit all students in rural area as well as all teachers. We in KORITEK, we believe the lack of adequate school resources and poor training of the teachers in rural area are the principal reasons we see so many countryside/village people flee to the cities leaving their villages with no hope for the future. With today new Technology, we are confident that those students don’t have to leave their home and they can be as competitive as those who live in the cities.
